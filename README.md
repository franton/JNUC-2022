# JNUC-2022
Repo from my JNUC 2022 talk on "Almost" Zero Touch deployment


Slides are located in the "Presentation Slides" folder

"DEP Notify" and "Jamf Connect" folders contain various scripts and launchagents or launchdaemons that I use.

NOTE: this will all need customised for your own uses. Will not work out of the box.
